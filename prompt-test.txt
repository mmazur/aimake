- If you've been explicitly instructed on which identifiers are public/exported, you're free to modify the ones not mentioned.
- Otherwise preserve all public/exported identifiers already present in the code.
- If the file being modified is already assigned to a module and/or package, you must preserve that assignment, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
