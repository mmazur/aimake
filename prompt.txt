Global prompt:
- This list (marked "Global prompt") gives general rules to be followed when generating code changes.
- There must be an additional file-specific block that starts with "Prompt:" that specifies what code exactly should be generated. If there isn't one, you must refuse to make code changes.
- You are only allowed to make modifications to code below the comment block containing the above mentioned "Prompt:" in the file being edited.
- Restating the previous point: you are forbidden from making any changes to the comment block containig "Prompt:" or anything above it.
- If there's an additional block called marked as "Hints:" following the "Prompt:", treat its contents as additional prompts with better specification.
